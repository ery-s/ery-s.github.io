        <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
        <hr class="section-rule">
        <p class="about-intro">
            I'm a developer with experience in C#, Java, JavaScript, and web development with passion for creative design. 
            I have completed my Bachelor's Degree in Computer and Information Sciences with a focus on Application Development at Varsity College (Emeris).
            </br></br>
            My technical skills include proficiency in Java, JavaScript, c# ,and HTML, along with some experience in Kotlin ,Arduino and Scratch. 
            Along with knowledge in Canva and Figma for mockups,prototyping and branding. 
            I've completed courses through online platforms like Codecademy, continuously enhancing my abilities.
            With over three years of experience in using Microsoft Office and Google Workspace.
            I have proficiency in Access, Excel, PowerPoint and Word further increasing my productivity through the use of these tools.
            </br></br>
            In addition to my technical skills, I'm a natural leader who excels in team environments.
            I firmly believe in the power of collaboration to achieve exceptional results. 
            When it comes to tackling challenges, I approach them with an innovative, out of the box mindset, consistently seeking unique solutions. 
            I held a position of leadership as the faculty representative for  the faculty of science and technology: school of computer science. 
            I also have experience as project management for several group assignments that have been a success.
            </br></br>
            In the tech world, I find joy in adding code to my robot projects, merging my love for technology with hands-on experimentation. 
            My commitment to excellence drives me to deliver high quality work from the get go, and I'm committed to continuous improvement and learning.
            Beyond the tech realm, I enjoy a diverse range of activities, including gardening, knitting, crocheting, and baking.
            These hobbies allow me to unwind, nurture creativity, and improve qualities that I also apply to my coding projects.
            </br></br>
            My passion lies in technology, and I bring creative problem-solving skills to every project I undertake. 
            I am genuinely passionate about making a positive impact. I am always ready to lend a helping hand. My compassion and kindness drive my actions.
            I'm excited about the opportunities to contribute to the growth and innovation in the field of technology.
